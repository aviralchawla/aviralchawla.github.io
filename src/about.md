<img src="/photos/solo_in_copenhagen.jpeg" alt="Aviral Chawla in Nyhavn, Copenhagen" class="about-image">

I am a computational social scientist and a Ph.D. candidate at the
[Vermont Complex Systems Institute](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/). My research broadly focuses on statistical methods applied to natural language. I am particularly interested in the intersection of natural language processing, computational ethics, and machine learning.
